# Webpush Data encryption library for Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/web-push-libs/pywebpush.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/web-push-libs/pywebpush)
[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/web-push-libs/pywebpush/requirements.svg?branch=main)](https://requires.io/github/web-push-libs/pywebpush/requirements/?branch=main)

This library is available on [pypi as pywebpush](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywebpush).
Source is available on [github](https://github.com/mozilla-services/pywebpush).
Please note: This library was designated as a `Critical Project` by PyPi, it is currently
maintained by [a single person](https://xkcd.com/2347/). I still accept PRs and Issues, but
make of that what you will.

## Installation

To work with this repo locally, you'll need to run `python -m venv venv`.
Then `venv/bin/pip install --editable .`


## Usage

In the browser, the promise handler for
[registration.pushManager.subscribe()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe)
returns a
[PushSubscription](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)
object. This object has a .toJSON() method that will return a JSON object that contains all the info we need to encrypt
and push data.

As illustration, a `subscription_info` object may look like:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/push/v1/gAA...",
  "keys": { "auth": "k8J...", "p256dh": "BOr..." }
}
```

How you send the PushSubscription data to your backend, store it
referenced to the user who requested it, and recall it when there's
a new push subscription update is left as an exercise for the
reader.

_*Note:*_ Some platforms (like Microsoft Windows) require additional
headers specified for the Push call. These additional headers are not
standard and may be rejected by other Push services. Please see
[Special Instructions](#special-instructions) below.

### Sending Data using `webpush()` One Call

In many cases, your code will be sending a single message to many
recipients. There's a "One Call" function which will make things
easier.

```python
from pywebpush import webpush

webpush(subscription_info,
        data,
        vapid_private_key="Private Key or File Path[1]",
        vapid_claims={"sub": "mailto:YourEmailAddress"})
```

This will encode `data`, add the appropriate VAPID auth headers if required and send it to the push server identified
in the `subscription_info` block.

#### Parameters

_subscription_info_ - The `dict` of the subscription info (described above).

_data_ - can be any serial content (string, bit array, serialized JSON, etc), but be sure that your receiving
application is able to parse and understand it. (e.g. `data = "Mary had a little lamb."`)

_content_type_ - specifies the form of Encryption to use, either `'aes128gcm'` or the deprecated `'aesgcm'`. NOTE that
not all User Agents can decrypt `'aesgcm'`, so the library defaults to the RFC 8188 standard form.

_vapid_claims_ - a `dict` containing the VAPID claims required for authorization (See
[py_vapid](https://github.com/web-push-libs/vapid/tree/master/python) for more details). If `aud` is not specified,
pywebpush will attempt to auto-fill from the `endpoint`. If `exp` is not specified or set in the past, it will be set
to 12 hours from now. In both cases, the passed `dict` **will be mutated** after the call.

_vapid_private_key_ - Either a path to a VAPID EC2 private key PEM file, or a string containing the DER representation.
(See [py_vapid](https://github.com/web-push-libs/vapid/tree/master/python) for more details.) The `private_key` may be
a base64 encoded DER formatted private key, or the path to an OpenSSL exported private key file.

e.g. the output of:

```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem
```

#### Example

```python
from pywebpush import webpush, WebPushException

try:
    webpush(
        subscription_info={
            "endpoint": "https://push.example.com/v1/12345",
            "keys": {
                "p256dh": "0123abcde...",
                "auth": "abc123..."
            }},
        data="Mary had a little lamb, with a nice mint jelly",
        vapid_private_key="path/to/vapid_private.pem",
        vapid_claims={
                "sub": "mailto:YourNameHere@example.org",
            }
    )
except WebPushException as ex:
    print("I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that: {}", repr(ex))
    # Mozilla returns additional information in the body of the response.
    if ex.response is not None and ex.response.json():
        extra = ex.response.json()
        print("Remote service replied with a {}:{}, {}",
              extra.code,
              extra.errno,
              extra.message
              )
```

### Methods

If you expect to resend to the same recipient, or have more needs than just sending data quickly, you
can pass just `wp = WebPusher(subscription_info)`. This will return a `WebPusher` object.

The following methods are available:

#### `.send(data, headers={}, ttl=0, reg_id="", content_encoding="aes128gcm", curl=False, timeout=None)`

Send the data using additional parameters. On error, returns a `WebPushException`

##### Parameters

_data_ Binary string of data to send

_headers_ A `dict` containing any additional headers to send

_ttl_ Message Time To Live on Push Server waiting for the client to reconnect (in seconds)

_reg_id_ Google Cloud Messaging registration ID (will be extracted from endpoint if not specified)

_content_encoding_ ECE content encoding type (defaults to "aes128gcm")

_curl_ Do not execute the POST, but return as a `curl` command. This will write the encrypted content to a local file
named `encrpypted.data`. This command is meant to be used for debugging purposes.

_timeout_ timeout for requests POST query.
See [requests documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#timeouts).

##### Example

to send to a user on Chrome:

```python
WebPusher(subscription_info).send(data, headers, ttl)
```

#### `.encode(data, content_encoding="aes128gcm")`

Encode the `data` for future use. On error, returns a `WebPushException`

##### Parameters

_data_ Binary string of data to send

_content_encoding_ ECE content encoding type (defaults to "aes128gcm")

_*Note*_ This will return a `NoData` exception if the data is not present or empty. It is completely
valid to send a WebPush notification with no data, but encoding is a no-op in that case. Best not
to call it if you don't have data.

##### Example

```python
encoded_data = WebPush(subscription_info).encode(data)
```

## Stand Alone Webpush

If you're not really into coding your own solution, there's also a "stand-alone" `pywebpush` command in the `./bin` directory.

This uses two files:

- the _data_ file, which contains the message to send, in whatever form you like.
- the _subscription info_ file, which contains the subscription information as JSON encoded data. This is usually returned by the Push `subscribe` method and looks something like:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://push...",
  "keys": {
    "auth": "ab01...",
    "p256dh": "aa02..."
  }
}
```

If you're interested in just testing your applications WebPush interface, you could use the Command Line:

```bash
./bin/pywebpush --data stuff_to_send.data --info subscription.info
```

which will encrypt and send the contents of `stuff_to_send.data`.

See `./bin/pywebpush --help` for available commands and options.

## Special Instructions

### Windows

[Microsoft requires](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/push-request-response-headers#request-parameters)
one extra header and suggests several additional headers. Users have reported that not including
these headers can cause notifications to fail to appear. These additional headers are non-standard
and may be rejected by other platforms. You should be cautious including them with calls to
non-Microsoft platforms, or to non-Microsoft destinations.

As of 2024-Apr-19, Microsoft requires an `X-WNS-Type` header. As an example, you can include this
header within the command line call:

Content of the `windows_headers.json` file:

```json
{"X-WNS-Type":"wns/toast", "TTL":600, "Content-Type": "text/xml"}
```

_*Note*_ : This includes both the `TTL` set to 10 minutes and the required matching `Content-Type` header for `wns/toast`.

```bash
pywebpush --data stuff_to_send.xml \
   --info edge_user_info.json \
   --head windows_headers.json \
   --claims vapid_claims.json
```

### Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)

Please note that GCM has been sunset by Google. Providers should
use [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/support/troubleshooter/fcm/tokens/gcm) instead.

Please also note that sending messages directly to FCM is not supported by this library. In the past, you could use an insecure `gcm_key` as a proxy for the authentication service. [This was disabled in June 2024](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-legacy-protocol-send-requests).

Sending WebPush messages to Google Chrome users should not be impacted by this change.
